## Data Modeling Exercises

Work in synergistic small groups, friendly pairs, or as a lone wolf. Draft JSON documents that model a real-world example. Be bold and experiment! Bonus points for making it overcomplicated but workable "in theory"!

### 1) Recipe website

##### Goal: Design a JSON document database for a recipe website.

Ideas for Content: 

- [ ] Ingredients
- [ ] Steps
- [ ] Comments
- [ ] Ratings

#### Follow-up questions (assuming your schema went to production):

1. How many queries does it take to get all the data related to a single recipe?
2. What would a query for the top ten ingredients look like?

### 2) Professional networking site

##### Goal: Design a JSON document database for a new professional networking site.

Ideas for Content: 

- [ ] Basic user profile info
- [ ] Skills
- [ ] Recommendations from other users
- [ ] Tracking who-looks-at-who 
- [ ] Employer profiles

#### Follow-up questions (assuming your schema went to production):

1. Imagine a user wants to learn about which users ("lookers") have seen their profile. How would you query to get the links to the profiles of each looker?
2. How can you query to estimate the amount of experience a person has (e.g. junior vs. senior)? How can you build a ranking for this?
